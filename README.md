# CINEMA  A-Z
This is a web app I have created for the SSL Project.

This app, created using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), is a database of movies and TV shows along with their ratings and comments from [IMDb](https://imdb.com), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com) and [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com).
The purpose of this app is to create a single destination for checking the reviews of specific movies or TV shows instead of looking for their ratings and reviews on multiple websites. Along with reviews, this app also allows users to create lists such as 'To Watch' and also shows where to watch the movies or TV shows.
 The functions of the app:
 1. Searching
 2. 3 User Lists
 3. Ratings for IMDb, RT, MC
 4. Reviews from IMDB, MC
 5. Reviews or Season Ratings from RT
 6. Data about the film (Duration, language, runtime)
 7. Plot
 8. Where to Watch
 9. Similar
